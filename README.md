What problem were you solving in the projects for this course?
We focused on different data models like binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists, and figuring out how to use them in different applications.

How did you approach the problem? Why are data structures important to understand?
I worked on understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and used them when their strengths were more useful than their weaknesses.

How did you deal with challenges while working on the activities or projects?
When I ran into problems, I checked the official documentation, looked for examples, or wrote small, simple bits of code to test an idea before building it into something final.

How has working on this project changed how you design software and write programs?
Big-O analysis made me think more about performance and how I write algorithms. I also noticed I tend to struggle with recursive thinking, which is something I want to get better at down the line.

How has this project changed the way you make your code easy to maintain, read, and adapt?
Iâ€™ve gotten better at writing code because of the practice from this course, I also understand better what makes code maintainable. For example, im thinking about turning some of the things I wrote and used a lot for this course, into libraries to save time later.
